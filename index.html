    <h2><strong> Choosing ideas </strong> </h2>

        <li> Targetting people who are willing to take TOPIK (Korean SAT) </li>
        <li> Make it easy for the visitors by showing them visual explanation </li>
        <li> I will put my own voice recording </li>
        <li> Someone will eventually donate some money to me for pity </li>
        <li> They need it for specific explanations on TOPIK questions in English </li>
      <ol style="color:red"> Top EDM musics of the weeks </ol>

  <h2><strong> The chosen idea </strong> </h2>
        <p> After we have talked with Mr. Chiu, we decided to work on AIS uniform policy website because it had clear audiences and client. </p>

  <h2><strong> Meeting with the client </strong> </h2>
        <p> We met with Mr. Hardistry during the class, and we have found that Mr. Hardisty did not want the background to blend with the things we put on the website </p>
        <p> Also, he wanted let people to easily navigate through the website. He said the reason why he wanted this website is he wants to save his time of explaining the rules and policy of the AIS uniforms</p>
  <h2><strong> Audience </strong> </h2>
      <p> After we met Mr. hardisty, Mr. Hardisty wanted us to make it clear that our website is particularly for AIS High School students. </p>
<div>
  <h2> <strong> Objectives </strong> </h2>
    <ul> Objectives of the website are </ul>
      <li> To let Mr. Hardisty save time by not explaining policies to students </li>
      <li> To let students understand the uniform policy without asking teachers </li>
      <li> To let students have access to uniform policy 24/7 </li>
      <li> To show AIS students that AIS has no tolerance of wrong uniform dress code </li>
  <h2> <strong> Success Criteria </strong> </h2>

      <tbody>

<h2><strong> Wireframes </strong></h2>
  <img src="Wireframe home.png" width="500px">
    <p> This is the homepage of the website, the page mainly suggests two buttons with the big pictures, the page suggests everything that a male AIS student should know and a female AIS student should know in AIS uniform policy. </p>
    <p> At the left side of the homepage, this page suggests specific policy. It works like remote control </p>
    <p> I made 2 buttons rather than no buttons because people do not have to look at the policies that they do not have to know </p>
    <img src="wireframe 2.png" width="500px">
  <p> This is the subpage of the website, if we click one of the male or female picture, it leads to something like this. </p>
  <p> It shows 3 pictures each, and the dos and donts are located at rightside of the page </p>
