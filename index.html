  <h2><strong> The chosen idea </strong> </h2>
        <p> After we have talked with Mr. Chiu, we decided to work on AIS uniform policy website because it had clear audiences and client. </p>

  <h2><strong> Meeting with the client </strong> </h2>
        <p> We met with Mr. Hardistry during the class, and we have found that Mr. Hardisty did not want the background to blend with the things we put on the website </p>
        <p> Also, he wanted let people to easily navigate through the website. </p>
