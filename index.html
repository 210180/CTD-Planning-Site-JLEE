  <h2><strong> The chosen idea </strong> </h2>
        <p> After we have talked with Mr. Chiu, we decided to work on AIS uniform policy website because it had clear audiences and client. </p>

  <h2><strong> Meeting with the client </strong> </h2>
        <p> We met with Mr. Hardistry during the class, and we have found that Mr. Hardisty did not want the background to blend with the things we put on the website </p>
        <p> Also, he wanted let people to easily navigate through the website. He said the reason why he wanted this website is he wants to save his time of explaining the rules and policy of the AIS uniforms</p>

<h2><strong> Wireframes </strong></h2>
  <img src="Wireframe home.png" width="500px">
    <p> This is the homepage of the website, the page mainly suggests two buttons with the big pictures, the page suggests everything that a male AIS student should know and a female AIS student should know in AIS uniform policy. </p>
    <p> At the left side of the homepage, this page suggests specific policy. It works like remote control </p>
    <p> I made 2 buttons rather than no buttons because people do not have to look at the policies that they do not have to know </p>
    <img src="wireframe 2.png" width="500px">
  <p> This is the subpage of the website, if we click one of the male or female picture, it leads to something like this. </p>
  <p> It shows 3 pictures each, and the dos and donts are located at rightside of the page </p>

<h2><strong> Home Page created by Fireworks </strong> </h2>

    <ul> Pros of using fireworks to create a website </ul>
      <li> it is really easy to blueprint the website that we want to create </li>
      <li> we can keep track of what we are doing easily with viewing the png file on chrome </li>
      <li> generally, it is really easy to use it because we do not have to code anything </li>
      <li> we can slice the parts that we want to separate from other things </li>
